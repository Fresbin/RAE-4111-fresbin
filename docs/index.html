<h1>Telecommunications Software RAE-411 Course Report</h1>

<h4>Week 14</h4>

<p> To create whole course report and upload those things in github. In each week we experienced with different langauges with the practical works and micro projects.</p> 
<hr>
<h4>Week 13</h4>

<p> Capturing Data Packets in BASH using Wireshark CLI.

   <li> By using the Wireshark CLI we can capture the data packets in BASH. </li>
    
    <p> We can use the following wireshark link to get helps for using the,<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCustCommandLine.html"> wireshark CLI</a> </p>

<p> We also worked more with the wireshark environment to get experienced with it. And also created a study guide on Github about "how to use the wireshark environment".</p>

<p> Installed R-shiny on our local computers </p>
<p> And also installed GRAFANA on our local computers.</p>
<hr>

<h4>Week 11</h4>

<p> Create a new personal project on GITHUB: 411-MTP

Combine Tools: Google Colab Notebook and Linux BASH Terminal

    Ping 5 hosts in five different countries (e.g. USA, DE, LV, IN, BR, ME, KO etc.) with a time interval 3 sec.
    Collect responses from 100 pings 
    Organise Data storage in five columns Pandas Data Frame
    On the next step, use Pandas DF to retrieve:
        data of ping RTT for each country, specifically:
            average
            standard deviation
            variance
            depict  Data using HISTOGRAMS (for each separate country)
        in a one Figure Integrated BOXPLOTs 
        </p>

<h4>Week 6</h4>

<p>
    Log into tsc.edx.lv
    In another tab, navigate to http://213.175.92.37:3104
    Copy Individual variant Figure file to a local computer
    Copy data vector values to a clipboard
    In tsc.edx.lv create a new document - MidTerm Exam #1
    Write report combining scripts utilising R and Python:
        Include original Figure file into Markdown document
        Inferential Statistics computing - Average Value or Mean ( X¯) and Standard Deviation ( σ) for given Data Set
        Figure recreation in both programming languages (R and Python) 
    Include Markdown Texts making Report concise and nice looking.
