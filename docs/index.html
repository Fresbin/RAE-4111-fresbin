<h1>Telecommunications Software RAE-411 Course Report</h1>

<h4>Week 14</h4>

<p> To create whole course report and upload those things in github. In each week we experienced with different langauges with the practical works and micro projects.</p> 
<hr>
<h4>Week 13</h4>

<p> Capturing Data Packets in BASH using Wireshark CLI.

   <li> By using the Wireshark CLI we can capture the data packets in BASH. </li>
    
    <li> We can use the following wireshark link to get helps for using the,<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCustCommandLine.html"> wireshark CLI</a> </li>

<li> We also worked more with the wireshark environment to get experienced with it. And also created a study guide on Github about "how to use the wireshark environment".</li>

   <li> Installed R-shiny on our local computers </li>
   <li> And also installed GRAFANA on our local computers.</li>
<hr>

<h4>Week 11</h4>

   <p> Create a new personal project on GITHUB: 411-MTP </li>

Combine Tools: Google Colab Notebook and Linux BASH Terminal

   <li> Ping 5 hosts in five different countries (e.g. USA, DE, LV, IN, BR, ME, KO etc.) with a time interval 3 sec.</li>
   <li> Collect responses from 100 pings </li>
   <li> Organise Data storage in five columns Pandas Data Frame</li>
    On the next step, use Pandas DF to retrieve:
        data of ping RTT for each country, specifically:
           <li> average</li>
           <li> standard deviation</li>
           <li> variance</li>
            <li>depict  Data using HISTOGRAMS (for each separate country</li>
       <li> in a one Figure Integrated BOXPLOTs </li>
        </p>
